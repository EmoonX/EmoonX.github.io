might as well say my final thoughts in an mp3 file.
hope you're enjoying the negative levels so far.

let me get right to the point: i'm not enjoying this. at all.
after two years of developing this riddle, i've finally hit a point where making levels in ZED isn't as fun as it is in the past.

riddle making is fun, i might as well consider it a hobby.
it's all the stress and hardships that's draining all the fun from it.
i noticed that i'm progressively spending less and less time from making these levels for the sake of my health because ZEDpuzzle is mentally draining me.

i thought -40 would make a good sendoff to end this puzzle right here. but no! 
i decided to cap it off at -39 instead. you guys anticipated for -40. no. it wasn't even a level from the start. 
it's only me rambling about how making this riddle is DETERIORATING my energy. it's better off dead. i should have stopped at the alphabet levels.

it's pulling me away from priorities that are MUCH more important than developing this puzzle. managing a server and the puzzle was easier back then, now SNAP BACK TO THE PRESENT. 
things are different because you guys showed up spamming the most obnoxious bullshit in the channels, and then a RAID happened,
adding stress to my already unstable mental health, making things 57 times difficult for me to manage a server. 
and to add insult to injury, a guy that i used to affilate with helping the riddle DOXXED me in front of my face, and i cut ties with them ever since.

in the end, this is what you get. not even a proper ending of ZED. i'm ready to throw this deadweight off my shoulders for my health's sake. you might say you guys were the creators all along.
